# Surfs_Up
## Purpose

UsingSQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask, create data frames that uses information from available Hawaiian Weather sites in order to provide context for an investor who is interested in opeining a surf shop with ice cream on the island of Oahu. Obviously, people will be more inclined to go to this business when the weather is clear and sunny. Because weather is inherently unpredictable, having an analysis of weather patterns over the last few years is an important part of the proposal to the investor. 

Therefore, the analysis will comprise temperature statistics for June and December from 2010-2017. 

## Results 

Six different weather stations provided data on temperature and rainfall. Three key differences in weather between June and December are as follows: 
- June has more points of data than December. 
- December data points are more spread out, ranging from 56 degrees to 83 degrees. 
- The mean temperature in June is 79.94 F and 71.04 F in December.

## Summary 
When analyzing the temperatures historically, it is clear that the majority of temperatures are above 70 degrees, making this location likely a solid investment for this business. Additional research could be done to determine what months have the most variance in temperature and how many months have a variance of more than 30 degrees.
